Not groovy discord bot.... Grooby


I am aware this bot uses a library that is no longer being supported

This bot plays youtube videos based on the text given in the -play command, and it can use playlist links or direct links aswell.
This bot is quite scuffed and breaks at some of the weirdest times.
This bot downloads music and adds it to the ./queue directory, which is not part of this repo

-play <song to play>
-join (BUG cannot play when bot is just joined using this command, don't use)
-leave
-clear
