# Grooby
Not groovy discord bot.... Grooby


Use python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies

The filesystem.py script should run automatically on first boot, if there is not a ./queue directory then run it manually.

# mf-dl is not mine, find it at *https://gitgud.io/Pyxia/mf-dl.git* was very useful to me and getting around the github file size limit

I am aware this bot uses a library that is no longer being supported

This bot plays youtube videos based on the text given in the -play command, and it can use playlist links or direct links aswell.

This bot is quite scuffed and breaks at some of the weirdest times.

This bot downloads music and adds it to the ./queue directory, which is not part of this repo

## testing changes is for losers


  -play <song to play>

  -leave
    -begone
    -stop
    -leave

  -clear

  -queue (lists the songs in the queue)

  -up
  -down (these are admin only if you're self-hosting, but there isn't any actual code to detect admin so make that yourself)

  -jace (designed to make fun of my friend who constantly plays tiktoks during match queues)

  -github (links to the github repos)
