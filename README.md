Not groovy discord bot.... Grooby


I am aware this bot uses a library that is no longer being supported

This bot plays youtube videos based on the text given in the -play command, and it can use playlist links or direct links aswell.

This bot is quite scuffed and breaks at some of the weirdest times.

This bot downloads music and adds it to the ./queue directory, which is not part of this repo

This is a test repo for me to learn how to use git gooder, I have a much more feature-rich bot on my personal stuff that will be committed when I learn how to use git good.

  -play <song to play>

  -leave

  -clear

  -queue (lists the songs in the queue)

  - up
  - down (these are admin only if you're self-hosting, but there isn't any actual code to detect admin to make that yourself)
